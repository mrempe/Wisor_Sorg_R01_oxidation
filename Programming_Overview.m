% Overview of code that needs to be written/run


 % Read in files (edf and/or txt after autoscored?)



 % Using baseline data determine best fit distributions of episode durations for Wake, SWS, REMS. 
 % I used dfittool before, but it may be nice to automate this.



 % Measure all 9 metrics in experimental data
 				% Number of episodes of each state
 				% episode duration for each state
 				% percent of time in each state



 % Run the model and compare model output to experimental data (for baseline and possibly more, like SD)




 % output the sleep state of the model to be used as input to a model of cortex or PNN or PV neurons
